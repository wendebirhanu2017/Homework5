        <item> Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the
            particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four
            basic steps; raw coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, the
            ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the
            liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds

            Espresso’s authentic formula is clear and basic, its proper execution a matter of training,
            experience and natural talent. A jet of hot water at 88°-93°C (190°-200°F) passes under a
            pressure of nine or more atmospheres through a seven-gram (.25 oz) cake-like layer of ground
            and tamped coffee. Done right, the result is a concentrate of not more than 30 ml (one oz) of pure
            sensorial pleasure

            Heat a few inches of vegetable oil to 300 degrees F in a heavy pot. In 3 or 4 batches, fry
            the potatoes about 4 to 5 minutes per batch, or until soft. They should not be brown at all at this
            point-you just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain them on new, dry
            paper towels

            While it is less likely that anyone would do this on their own if they are not a beekeeper,
            this might be useful for those who aspire to become one. Bees are really great and easy to keep,
            even in the urban environment! As Novella Carpenter calls them, bees are animal for urban. All
            you need is some space in the backyard/deck. The process of honey harvesting and extraction
            most likely happens on a separate days. These are the tools required.

            Sugar cubes are extremely simple to make at home - all you need is sugar and water. In
            addition to standard cubes, you can add color and flavor to add fun flair to a tea party or another
            gathering. Learn how to make sugar cubes using two different methods: using a pan in the oven
            or an ice cube tray you leave out overnight.
